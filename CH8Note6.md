    Microsoft Windows:Microsoft's Windows operating system, with multiple versions such as Windows 10 and Windows Server, dominates the global market and serves various purposes, from personal computing to cloud-based information hosting.
    Linux: Linux is a free and open-source family of operating systems that can be modified and distributed by anyone, in contrast to proprietary systems like Windows.
    The AWS Compute service:In Amazon Web Services, there are four broad categories of compute services. These are: Virtual Machines, Containers, Serverless andPlatform as a Service
    Virtual Machines: Amazon EC2 is a cloud service that provides scalable computing power, allowing developers to easily configure and manage virtual machines in Amazon's reliable environment for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) applications.
    Serverless:AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows you to run code without managing servers, paying only for the actual compute time used, and is part of the broader concept of serverless computing where code deployment is event-driven and infrastructure management is abstracted.
    Containers: Amazon Web Services offers container services for efficient workload management, with AWS Fargate simplifying administration for those new to containers.
    Platform as a Service: Platform as a Service (PaaS), like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, empowers developers to focus on coding and application development while relinquishing control over the underlying infrastructure.
## 8.4
    Selecting Compute Resources: Choosing the right compute resources, balancing performance and cost, helps achieve more with less. Make informed decisions by aligning workload needs with resource choices.
    Instances: Cloud instances are virtual servers in AWS that can be easily customized for performance and features, providing flexibility to adapt to changing computing requirements.
    Containers: Containers enable isolated execution of applications and their dependencies, and AWS offers options like Fargate, EC2, ECS, and EKS for managing them in the cloud.
    Functions: Functions, such as AWS Lambda, decouple code execution from server management, enabling code execution without the need for running server instances.
    Best Practices for Selecting Compute Resources:
    Evaluate the available compute options: Assess compute options: Understand how instances, containers, and functions perform and their impact on your workload.
    Understand the available compute configuration options: To maximize system efficiency, it's crucial to comprehend how various compute configuration options, such as instance types, features (like GPUs and I/O), and tenancy models, align with and benefit your specific workload.
    Collect compute-related metrics: Recording and tracking resource utilization provides essential data for making precise resource requirement assessments and optimizing computer system performance.
    Determine the required configuration by right-sizing: Assess your workload's performance characteristics, including memory, network, and CPU usage, to choose the most appropriate resources, such as r-family instances for memory-intensive workloads or elastic container systems for bursting tasks
    Use the available elasticity of resources: Leveraging cloud elasticity involves dynamically adjusting resources based on workload demands and compute metrics to optimize performance and cost efficiency.
    Re-evaluate compute needs based on metrics: Continuously monitor system-level metrics to adapt and optimize your compute environment based on your workload's evolving requirements, such as switching to more suitable instance types or sizes when necessary, for improved performance and efficiency.
